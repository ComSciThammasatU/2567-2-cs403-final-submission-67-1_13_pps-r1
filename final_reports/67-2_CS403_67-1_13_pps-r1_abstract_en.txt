However, identifying the gap between knowledge gained from university education and the skills required by the job market remains a challenge. This paper presents a personalized course-recommendation system that leverages semantic similarity between job descriptions and course descriptions to suggest the most relevant coursework for learners. After filtering out courses a user has already completed, the system ingests web-scraped job postings from JobsDB and official university course catalogs, then transforms all text into vector representations using four embedding techniques, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, and Sentence-BERT. Cosine similarity between a target job profile and each candidate course generates a ranked list of recommendations. The systemžs performance is quantitatively assessed through Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) ranking based on relevance judgments from domain-specific undergraduate students, enabling direct comparison of each embedding strategy. By combining multi-modal data sources with NLP models and rigorous NDCG evaluation, this framework offers a promising solution for closing the gap between learnersž academic backgrounds and real-world job demands.Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Cosine similarity, Job recommendation system, Course recommendation system, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
